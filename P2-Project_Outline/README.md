## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our app, Countdown is a media/event tracker that allows unauthorized users to browse media/events that will be released soon.  Authorized users will be allowed to save event/media cards to their personal dashboard so they can keep track of upcoming events/releases that they are interested.  Our MVP will start with tracking soon to be released movies, but will be expanded to include other media.

### Features

Users will be able to:
  - Register an account
  - Login to their account
  - Save event/media cards that interest them
  - Delete event/media cards that they are no longer interested in
  - Create their own events

### Technologies

  - C#
  - Angular
  - ASP.NET
  - Entity
  - MySql

### What I'll Have to Learn

We will have to build on our prior knowledge of C#, Angular and the other technologies to get it to work for the features we want.  We will have to learn how to connect  a C# API with an Angular front end to implement CRUD and user authentication.
